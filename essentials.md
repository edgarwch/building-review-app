# OVERVIEW

## Project & User Management

Multi-project support: create and switch between different job sites or buildings.

User roles & permissions: admins, inspectors, reviewers—each sees only the data they need.

Team assignments: assign inspectors or teams to specific projects or inspection rounds.

## Inspection Checklists & Templates

Customizable checklists: define standard inspection items (e.g. fire doors, railings, wiring) that you can reuse or adapt per project.

Regulation-driven templates: out-of-the-box templates for common codes (e.g. local fire code, structural safety standards) that you can update as rules change.

Scoring & pass/fail logic: automatically calculate an overall compliance score or flag critical failures.

## Detailed Notes & Media Capture

Rich-text comments: for each checklist item, allow detailed descriptions, observations or “what happened.”

Photo & video attachments: capture evidence on the spot, annotate images, and link media to specific checklist points.

Voice memos: record quick audio notes if typing isn’t practical on site.

## Offline & Mobile-First Experience

Offline data capture: work without connectivity and sync when back online—critical on remote sites.

Responsive/mobile UI: big buttons, simple forms, finger-friendly controls—so inspectors aren’t fighting tiny text fields.

## Scheduling & Notifications

Inspection calendar: schedule upcoming inspections, set recurring inspections (e.g. monthly fire-safety walk-throughs).

Reminders & alerts: email or push notifications for upcoming or overdue inspections.

## Reporting & Export

PDF/Word report generation: compile a polished report with checklist results, photos, signatures, and recommendations.

Custom branding: include company logo, inspector’s name, project details.

CSV/Excel export: raw data dump for further analysis or archival.

## Sign-off & Audit Trail

Digital signatures: inspectors and supervisors sign off electronically at the end of an inspection.

Version history: track changes to checklists, comments, or templates.

Time-stamped logs: who did what and when—for compliance and accountability.

## Analytics & Dashboards

Pass/fail trends: widget showing rate of non-compliance over time or by building.

Top issues: automatically identify the most frequently failed items (e.g. “75% of fire doors need adjustment”).

Team performance: compare completion rates or average inspection scores across inspectors.

## Integration & Data Import/Export

Regulatory code libraries: pull in the latest standards from an API or database.

BIM/CAD integration (advanced): link inspections to specific floor plans or model elements.

QR/barcode scanning: quickly look up equipment or location details by scanning a tag on site.

## Security & Compliance

Data encryption: protect sensitive building plans and inspection notes both in transit and at rest.

Access logging: record login attempts and data exports.

Role-based data visibility: ensure contractors only see what they’re allowed to see.
